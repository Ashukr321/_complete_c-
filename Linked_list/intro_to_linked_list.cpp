// A linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element contains a pointer to the next element in the list. This makes linked lists very flexible and efficient for storing data that is frequently being added to or removed from the list.

// To create a linked list in C++, you can use the `std::list` class. This class provides a number of methods for creating, manipulating, and iterating over linked lists. For example, to create a linked list of integers, you can use the following code:

// This code will create a linked list with three elements: 1, 2, and 3. The `std::list` class also provides a number of other methods for manipulating linked lists, such as inserting, deleting, and
